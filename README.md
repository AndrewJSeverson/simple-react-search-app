# Simple React Search App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

NOTE that create-react-app comes with many utilities and packages through the 'react-scripts' package including webpack, babel, and many others. I chose to keep this package for simplicity but production builds should eject and only include packages being used by the application.

## Installing

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/AndrewJSeverson/simple-react-search-app.git'
cd simple-react-search-app
npm install
```

## Running The App

```bash
npm start
```

## Linting
```bash
npm run lint
```

## Available Scripts - through create-react-app

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`
